# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the latest draft build to production so the production URL matches the current draft functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Trigger and complete a production deployment of the current build.
- Verify production loads without errors and core flows work end-to-end (Internet Identity login, profile setup, car price prediction submission, prediction history viewing).

**User-visible outcome:** Visiting the production URL loads the same working app experience as the draft build, including login, profile setup, submitting car price predictions, and viewing prediction history.

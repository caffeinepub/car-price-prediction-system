  "summary": "BuildRequest REQ-1 is a publish-only production deployment with no feature/behavior changes. The diff does not show any deployment trigger/configuration changes, but it does include backend and auth-hook modifications plus documentation and summaries that describe multiple new/changed frontend features, which violates the publish-only constraint.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Publish the current build (latest draft) to production so the live production URL serves the same functionality as the draft build.",

      "description": "Changes to car price prediction logic/data model (e.g., introducing yearOfPurchase/usageDuration validations and extended result structure such as breakdown/adjustments).",
